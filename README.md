# AIM_Coursework
## This is a repository containing:
1. The files that were used to carry out the experiments
2.. The datasets produced by performing experiments on the 24 benchmark functions given in the BBOB-2010 competition.
The experiments were performed for the dim = [2,3,5,10,20,40], each experiment running for 15 different instances each instance having a maximum function evaluation of 5000. The seed is fixed for each of the experiments to be 0.
3. The post-processed data produced using the post-processing toolbox that is part of the COCO framework. The post-processed data includes comparisons between
	1. CMAES vs DE vs PSO
	2. CMAES vs DE
	3. CMAES vs PSO
